# Week 7

This week we are working on graphing wildfire data for Wildlife Season!

To start, download the `WildfiresByYear.csv` document.

## Part 1

Load the data into Python (or your programming language of choice)

## Part 2

Install/Import MatPlotLib 

## Part 3

Create a simple graph using pre-defined points, just to make sure it works!
For an example follow [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-plot-in-python-using-matplotlib/)

## Part 4

Using the exmaple above, try to create a plot of wildfire data by number of fires

## Part 5

Create a plot of wildfire data by acreage burned

## Part 6

Recreate the same graphs as above as a **Bar Graph**

## Part 7

Recreate the graphs above into a **Single** [Scatter Plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/scatter_demo2.html) where the X axis is the year, Y is the number of burns, and the size of the circle is the Acreage.
