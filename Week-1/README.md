# Happy Hour - Week 1

#### *Theme:* 
Prime Numbers

#### *Challenge:* 
Write the 'logic' for the code (excluding user input) in as few lines as possible. If this proves too hard, use as few 'if/else' statements as possible

## Problems

#### Problem 1

Using a programming language of your choice, write code that prints the first 10 prime numbers 
(without hard coding in the prime numbers before hand...)

#### Problem 2

Take a user's input for a number and print true or false if the number they entered is a prime number

#### Problem 3

Take a user's input (n) and print the `n`'th prime number.  

#### Problem 4

Take a user's input (n) and print the `n`'th prime number **that ends in a 7**. (7 would be the first)

#### Problem 4.5

Same as problem 4, but only `n > 100` and it must run under 3 seconds

#### Problem 5

Take a user input and return a prime number that is that many digits long
