# Happy Hour - Week 1

#### *Theme:* 
File IO (CSV)

#### *Challenge:* 
Produce the most (but still *useful*) statistics about the given CSV

## Problems

#### Problem 1

Using a programming language of your choice, write code that reads a CSV file and prints every line to the terminal

*Challenge:* Make the lines print out in the format of a table

#### Problem 2

Using 'Users.csv', figure out the average years of programming experience for people at Cerium.

*Challenge:* Find the most and least years of programming experience. If there are ties, display all

#### Problem 3

Print all of the favorite programming languages, along with the amount of people that said that programming language was their favorite.

*Challenge:* Print these in order of most-favorite to least-favorite

#### Problem 4

Add an extra column to the CSV to show how the number of years of experience a user has compares to the average years of programming experience (difference, standard deviation, etc.)

*Challenge 1:* Do the above in another new column, but compare them only to others that have the same favorite programming language

*Challenge 2:* Order the users by years of experience progamming

###### - OR - 

Create a copy of 'Users.csv' called 'Sorted.csv' with all of the same information, but alphabetically sorted by first name, and written to a new file. 

*Challenge:* Without editing the CSV, sort by last name instead!


#### Problem 5

Using Matplotlib (a python exclusive), create a bar graph (or bar graphs) of misc. information in 'Users.csv'.

*Hint:* Check out [this](https://datatofish.com/bar-chart-python-matplotlib/) blog as an example of how to use the library! Also check out the [Official Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html)

Examples: 

1.
    - X, Programming Language
    - Y, # Of Favorites

2. 
    - X, Programming Language
    - Y, Average Years of Experience

3. 
    - X, Programming Language
    - Y, Total Years of Experience

4.
    - X, Letters
    - Y, # Of Names Starting with 'Letter'
